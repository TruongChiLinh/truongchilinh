note :
1. User Interface (UI)
Role: The UI represents the web or mobile frontend where users interact with the trading system.
Description: It interacts with the system via RESTful APIs or WebSockets, handling user actions like placing orders, viewing balances, and checking the trading history.

2. API Gateway (ALB - Application Load Balancer)
Role: Acts as an entry point to the backend, handling incoming traffic from clients.
Description: The ALB will distribute incoming API requests to different services. It allows load balancing, SSL termination, and can scale dynamically.

3. Microservices (Order Service, Trade Service)
Role: These services handle specific functionalities like managing orders and executing trades.
Description: The microservices approach helps keep the application modular and allows scaling of specific services based on demand. It also simplifies development and testing. We are using AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to deploy microservices, depending on the complexity of the deployment.

4. Message Queue (AWS SQS)
Role: Decouples microservices for asynchronous communication.
Description: The message queue ensures that orders and trade executions are handled asynchronously, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. SQS (Simple Queue Service) will buffer the requests and help distribute the load between services.

5. Database Cluster (Amazon RDS)
Role: Stores transactional data like user balances, order details, and trade history.
Description: Amazon RDS will handle database management, ensuring reliability with multi-AZ deployments for high availability. For this trading system, we can use Amazon Aurora with MySQL or PostgreSQL for better scalability and performance. Aurora automatically replicates data across multiple AZs and can scale storage and read replicas dynamically.

6. Caching Layer (Amazon ElastiCache)
Role: Caches frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
Description: Redis or Memcached will be used for caching high-demand data like order books, prices, and user sessions. ElastiCache helps speed up responses by offloading requests from the database.

7. Logging & Metrics (AWS CloudWatch)
Role: Monitors system performance, logs events, and provides insights.
Description: CloudWatch will be used for centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting. It helps identify issues early and track response times and throughput. We can configure custom metrics to measure specific application KPIs, such as latency and error rates.

8. Load Balancer (AWS ALB/ELB)
Role: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of services for load balancing.
Description: The load balancer ensures that traffic is evenly distributed, providing fault tolerance. It will work in conjunction with the auto-scaling group to ensure resources scale up or down based on traffic demands.

Role: It serves as the web or mobile application interface for end users, allowing them to access and interact with the transaction system.
Description: Users will interact with the API through transaction commands, account updates, and checking transaction information.

2 .API Gateway (ALB)
Role: It acts as the main entry point for API requests from users.
Description: The API Gateway receives HTTP requests from the client and routes them to the corresponding backend services. The ALB load balancer will distribute the traffic evenly among the microservices.

3 .Authentication Service (AWS Cognito)
Role: User authentication and management.
Description: AWS Cognito will handle user login and authentication, making it easier to manage access rights and security for APIs.

4 .Microservices (Order Management, Trade Service)

Description: ElastiCache uses Redis to cache information such as pricing tables, user data, and unprocessed orders.

6 .Database (DynamoDB and RDS Aurora)
Role: Store transaction and user-related data.
Description:

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with high scalability, used for storing data that does not require complex relationships.
RDS Aurora is a relational database that stores transactional and user account data with relationships.
EventBridge (Event-Driven Architecture)
Role: Manage and distribute events across the system.
Description: EventBridge will manage and send transaction events (such as placed orders, completed trades) to various services in the system, enabling asynchronous processing.

7 .Message Queue (SQS)
Role: Manage and process transaction notifications.
